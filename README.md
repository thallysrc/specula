# Speculari

It is a work in progress SIEM that I'm design to be very simple

The core language is Rust for performance and simplicity, I did not choose C because Rust can achieve the same/similar results with better code. It should have a agent(to gather logs and data), a processing unit(to clear data and use the intel acquired) and finally a dashboard.
It should be a long term project and I intent to be a usefull community project, and I'm looking for contributors that know or want to learn rust and cybersecurity.
